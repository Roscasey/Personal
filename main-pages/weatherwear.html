            <p>The purpose of this project is to design an application aimed at addressing the issue of packing and selecting appropriate outfits when people are unfamiliar with the local climate of their destination.</p>
            <p><b>Identifying the Issue: </b>More often than not, packing for trips comes with stress and frustrations.</p>
            <ol class="w_issue_list">
                <li>Travellers are tasked with packing appropriate and sufficient clothing for travelling to various destinations. This process requires extensive research, making the process extremely time-consuming. </li>
                <li>Additionally, many travellers run into the issue of either inevitably needing to purchase more clothing once they've arrived or must now lug around excessive luggage. </li>
                <li> The temperature predicted by local weather forecasters will feel drastically different to travellers due to environmental factors such as climate zones causing humidity, dryness and other elements. </li>
                <li>This uncertainty leads to challenges when deciding what items of clothing to bring along and discomfort in clothing.</li>

            <p><b>Situation of Use</b></p>
            <p>The chosen situation of use focuses on helping travellers understand and be familiar with what items of clothing are appropriate to bring along during a trip with the destination's weather forecast as a guide. This will help reduce stress whilst planning and avoid unpredictable weather, leading to an overall more enjoyable journey.</p>
            <p><b>Solution</b></p>
            <p>With a team of 5 UX Design Students, I designed Weather Wear, which analyses users' destinations, trip duration and preferences along with real-time weather data to solve these problems.</p>
            <p><b>My Role</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Research and investigate the paradoxes which affect the Situation of Use.</li>
                <li><b>Low-Fidelity Design -</b> Wireframe, sketch and propose potential design directions for the prototype.</li>
                <li>Analyse user interview responses and implement features which address user concerns.</li>
                <li><b>High-Fidelity Design -</b> Using Figma, design a prototype reflecting the user research findings and adhere to a cohesive brand identity.</li>

            <p>Based on the conducted research, it was determined that interviewee's had major concerns in regards to packing and dressing for travel. These concerns were categorised into 4 major themes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Weather: </b>Such as weather inaccuracy.</li>

               <p><b>1. Think-Aloud Protocol: </b>This form of evaluation revealed participants' confusion, preferences and expectations of the features and content in the prototype. Participants were asked to verbalise their thoughts as they interacted with the prototype; therefore, highlighting design issues such as mismatches with mental models, frustrations with efficiency and confusion over error messages.</p>
               <p><b>2. Task-Based Usability Testing: </b>This was implemented to assess the prototype design, by assigning users with specific tasks as they navigated through Weather Wear. This ensured that we were able to govern the user's actions and receive specific feedback of certain features, while still allowing them the autonomy to explore the design.</p>
               <p><b>3. Open-Ended Questioning: </b>Following each of the prescribed tasks,  open-ended questioning was utilised to encourage participants to reflect on their experiences, share opinions and offer suggestions for improvements. This technique assisted in identifying design issues and misalignments with user expectations.</p>

                <p>Based on the 3 evaluation techniques, evidence was collected through multiple channels. Firstly, participants provided verbal feedback, sharing spontaneous comments on aspects like icon visibility and functionality. Secondly, behavioural observations highlighted specific issues with certain features and screens, as well as misinterpretations of buttons and icons. Additionally, we observed users' task completion levels and noted that many tasks were more complex than expected, indicating the need for clarification on certain tasks.</p>

                <li>Improving navigation and usability by having clearer labels for features and streamline the dashboard for improved organisation </li>

            <h1 class="section_break_head accent weather_head">Conclusion</h1>
            <p>As a result of the User Observations, I conclude that Weather Wear's design effectively addresses the problems identified in the Situation of Use through its implemented features. The Situation of Use acknowledges the time-consuming process of researching and organising clothing suitable for the travel destination's weather.</p> 
            <p>Through the design and implementation of relevant technologies, I aimed to alleviate the challenges which emerged from our Situation of Use. These included issues such as making misinformed clothing decisions due to inaccurate weather forecasts, which ultimately leads to disorganised luggage.</p> 
            <p> Additionally, I strived to address the inconvenience caused by having to purchase extra clothing due to weather-related under preparation. Enlightened by these challenges, I, along with my group-members, designed our prototype with the objective of improving the Situation of Use, rather than attempting to solve the paradox of misguided clothing decisions completely. </p>
            <p><i>Consequently, the future development of Weather Wear becomes subjective and offers numerous perspectives for its progression. Based on our findings, I believe that Weather Wear can be cohesively integrated into people's daily lives and trips, for both infrequent and frequent travellers. </i></p>
