            <p>A casual chat with friends turned into a project. Between work colleagues, family members and university friends - a common frustration was the search for new restaurants.</p>
            <p><b>Why? - </b>Endless tabs and lists are hard to keep track of. Thus, Nibbles was formed  - A food diary to save restaurants you want to visit, are planning to visit and ones you already have!</p>

                <p>Nibbles was a great project to work on and my first personal case study. Finding new ways to facilitate everyday experiences was a rewarding process, where I myself, did not even realise that the use of separate applications to perform one task was inconvenient. Overall, it was difficult to think of something new and not redundant and I would love it if Nibbles came to life one day.</p>

                <p><b>1. I cannot accommodate to certain aspects: </b>One of the trends was the use of TikTok. After seeing this outcome, I aimed to incorporate TikTok into my design too; however, I realised that Nibbles was becoming an extension of TikTok, rather than its own application. Thus, I learned that it is best to design a platform that will address a variety of user needs, however, one that remains unique to its name.</p>
                <p><b>2. The use of logos/branding: </b>In my early designs, I aimed to included the logo and title of Nibbles onto every screen. However, after doing some research and viewing other and well-designed mobile applications, I realised that there is no need to include such a large title.</p>
                <p><b>3. Not everything has to have a different colour: </b>The biggest mistake I made was adding too much contrast and colour in my designs. However, again, after reviewing other applications, I then made the change to simplify my mobile application and keep the design consistent and neat.</p>
