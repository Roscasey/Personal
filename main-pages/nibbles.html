            <p>A casual chat with friends turned into a project. Between work colleagues, family members and university friends - a common frustration was the search for new restaurants.</p>
            <p><b>Why? - </b>Endless tabs and lists are hard to keep track of. Thus, Nibbles was formed  - A food diary to save restaurants you want to visit, are planning to visit and ones you already have!</p>
