            <p><b>Communication: </b>Judith did not have a formal ordering system for her small-business as her main form of communication was through Facebook.</p>
            <p><b>Product Display: </b> Facebook made it difficult for Judith to display all of her products. Many of her customers were not aware of all of the products she sold.</p>

                <p>Judith's Creations was my first project that involved a real-life client. As a result, I found it challenging to design a website that would be unique and effective. Overall, although the website may be simple, I am happy to have achieved Judith's goals and create a design that she is proud of and one that she feels embodies her brand.</p>

            <div class="section_space_within">
                <h2 class="project_heading_sub project_heading_sub_space">What did I learn?</h2>
                <p><b>1. The need for simplicity: </b>With the pressure of making a unique design, I aimed to create an overly complex design with too many aesthetic clashes. Furthermore, the size of my logo and headings were too large, making the design unbalanced.</p>
                <p><b>2. Design standards: </b>Consistency with design in relation to similar websites is important, for users to become familiar with the website. I made the mistake of aiming to make a “new” layout which confused participants.</p>
                <p><b>3. The vitality of continuous communication: </b>As I made new propositions to Judith, I made the mistake of not communicating earlier and more frequently. I had to change several aspects of my design propositions to suit her desires for her business needs.</p>
