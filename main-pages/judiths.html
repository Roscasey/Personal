            <p><b>Communication: </b>Judith did not have a formal ordering system for her small-business as her main form of communication was through Facebook.</p>
            <p><b>Product Display: </b> Facebook made it difficult for Judith to display all of her products. Many of her customers were not aware of all of the products she sold.</p>
